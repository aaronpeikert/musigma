Mu Sigma is a group of people that are highly interested in theory and application of statistical science. It was organized by several students and alumni of Humboldt University in the spring of 2019. We now have members of different ages and backgrounds, including leading data scientist from several Berlin companies. The main goal of Mu Sigma is to gain better understanding of statistics by bringing motivated people together, sharing our experience, and working through papers or other sources of information.

The discussions in our meetings have a rather broad scope but mainly revolve around following topics:
* Epistemology: What is knowledge and how it should be obtained? What is the role of statistics in that process?
* The proper application of statistical methods in research and working environment
* Newest trends in data science
* Ongoing replicability crisis (especially in social sciences)
* Technicalities of particular statistical methods and/or software

A good way to understand what Mu Sigma is about is to check out the papers and the protocols of our last meetings:
* The list of the papers we've already read is available in [our meetup archive](meetup_archive.md)
* The list of papers proposed to read in the future is available [here](reading-list.md)
* The detailed protocols or our meetings are available in the [following folder](/protocols)

#### How can I contact you?
To contact us, feel free to write us a message on musigma.berlin@gmail.com or in [our public Telegram group](https://t.me/mu_sigma).

#### How and where can I attend your meetup?
Please contact us on Telegram or via Email and do a short introduction of yourself. After getting to know you, we will tell you the location of our next meetup. We don't publish the place we meet beforehand but it is normally in the central areas of Berlin.  
The attendance is free of charge.

#### What background should I have to participate?
To be able to follow the discussion, attendees are expected to have at least some knowledge of statistics, programming, and mathematics. A solid college undergrad level should generally suffice, although some papers often go way above these knowledge. Apart from that, we don't have any special requirements except willingnes to participate and learn actively.

#### Does Mu Sigma have a focus on any field?
It is necessary to note that Mu Sigma was founded by students of psychology, sociology, and economics, among others. Thus, there is a slight focus on application of statistical methods in behavioral sciences. Nevertheless, we sometimes discuss papers from other fields, such as biology or physics, and/or "general" statistics. 

#### Is this another ML or AI meetup?
Except the point stated above, we do not position ourselves as a meetup that is about particular school of methods. We rather look *how* to use *all* available methods and tools in order to get the necessary results in data science. We are also not a "meetup" in the classical sense and do not organize networking or hiring events (yet). Nevertheless, there's always a chance that you meet someone who helps you in your professional career later.

#### Do you organize anything else except the meetups?
So far the regular meetings are the only thing we organize right now. In perspective, we might expand our activities to inviting speakers, providing education, doing collective projects, and so on. If you have any suggestions or offers, don't hesitate to contact us.

#### Which programming language do you work with?
There is no single programming language required. As far as our last meetups are concerned, most of the participants work either in R or Python.

#### Are you guys bayesians or frequentists? Data or algorithmic modelling?
Again, we prefer not to go for a *single* approach but rather discuss them all together in a mostly non-violent way. Participants with all views and backgrounds are welcome.

#### Do I need to read the paper before attending the meetup?
Yes, the discussion of paper is an important part of our meetup, so everyone should at least skim through the paper beforehand. However, it is not expected from everyone to understand in details the technicalities of every paper.

#### Why are you called Mu Sigma?
We didn't want to go with yet another typical name like "Berlin Data Science Meetup" and decided to pick something unique instead. We have chosen those two Greek letters just because they are often met in statistics (the population mean and variance, respectively) and sound good in combination. Apart from that, there's no additional meaning to the name to our society.
