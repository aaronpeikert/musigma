  The pcalg package for R (R Development Core Team 2014) can be used for the following two purposes: Causal structure learning and estimation of causal e???ects from observational and/or interventional data. In this document, we give a brief overview of the methodology, and demonstrate the package's functionality in both toy examples and applications.

In this package, some Causal Search Algorithms are implemented. They give a short introduction on the Methodology, and then discuss the different algorithms in more detail.
I would propose reading the first 2 paragraphs (12 pages) for the first meeting, which is the methodological introduction.
Then, if we want to dive in further, we could read the rest for the next meeting and try it practically.
